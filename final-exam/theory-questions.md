#### The deque is part of which python library?
- Deque which is double-ended queue is part of the colLections module in the python library

#### What 2 differences that distinguish a tree from a graph?
- One of the differences that distinguish a tree from a graph is that it is inherently acyclic which means there are no loop/cycles whereas a graph is cyclic

- Another main difference that distinguish a tree from a graph is that in the trees are inherently directional whereas graphs have a specfic direction

#### Give the definitions of time complexity and space complexity
- Time complexity is the amount of tim

- Space complexity is how much computer memory an algorithmn needs based on the size of the inputs its working with 

#### Describe the bubble sort algorithm and its complexity. What is guaranteed at the end of the first pass?
- Bubble sort algorithm is comparing a list of items / numbers and swapping neighbouring items repeatedly if they are in the wrong order -  in terms of complexity its normally slow. What is guranteed at the end of the first pass is that the highest number / item will bubble to the right as you iterate through the items

#### Explain what LIFO and FIFO are and how each works in practice with a named data structure
LIFO AND FIFO are part of the Queue and collections python module 

LIFO: Last in, First Out - The last item added is the first one out/removed. LIFO is commonly used in data structure called Stack. In a stack you can push items to the top which then pop at the top. This works in practice, for example, on the cfg website if the user wanted to click back they will return to the first page they first visited. 

FIFO: First in, First out - The first item added will be the first item out/removed. FIFO uses the Queue class / data structure where items/ elements are added to the rear and are then removed from the front. For example in a queue the first person to be served is the first person to leave followed by the next person


#### What is a Balanced Binary Tree and what would be the best root? Walkthrough how you search using this structure.

A balanced binary tree is looking and comparing the heights and depth for every node in a left and right of a subtree will differ by at most 1.
